### If you made any assumptions, what are they
- The submit button should be disabled while calling API
- The submit button should be disabled if the first load and the form is invalid
- "+ ADD ANOTHER REFERRAL" button will be hidden if number of referrals > 5

### Outline what else needs to be done if given more time
- I will validate form On value Changing instead of onBlur, then I will use debounce for each field of form
- The top green message area will be a result component, it can show a success message in green background or a failed red failure in red background
- The top green message area should has close button
